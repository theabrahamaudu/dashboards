Dashboards made with Power BI

- [Emissions Dashboard](https://github.com/theabrahamaudu/dashboards/blob/main/Emissions-Dashboard-1.png)  
  This dashboard was made using data from the UN FAO as obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/total-emissions-per-country-2000-2020)  
  Data cleaning for the dashboard was done using Python. The data cleaning was done as part of a [previous project](https://github.com/theabrahamaudu/emissions_prediction) which utilised the same dataset.
